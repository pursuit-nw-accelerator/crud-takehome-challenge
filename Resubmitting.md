| "The DELETE route should return the record that was deleted."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Modified the `deleteExistingApplication` function to return the deleted record in the response.    | Sent a DELETE request for an existing application and verified the response includes the deleted record. |
| "The DELETE route should return the record that was deleted. A 204 (No Content) response is not correct."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Changed the status code in the `deleteExistingApplication` function to return a 200 status code.   | Checked the status code of the DELETE response to ensure it was 200.                                     |
| "Your controller file is a collection of methods but does not create an instance of an Express Router, which is preferred."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Refactored the controller file to create an instance of an Express Router and define routes on it. | Ensured all routes are accessible and correctly handled by the Express Router.                           |
| "Your application does not catch server errors or return 500 responses for server-side errors."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Added try-catch blocks around asynchronous operations to catch and respond with server errors.     | Induced server errors to ensure a 500 status code is returned.                                           |
| "Your PUT and DELETE handlers should check that a job application exists before trying to update or delete it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Added checks in PUT and DELETE routes to verify if an application exists before proceeding.        | Tested PUT and DELETE on non-existent IDs to confirm a 404 response.                                     |
| "Not implemented. Your app should check that the :id param can be parsed as a positive integer. Simply calling parseInt() does not accomplish this because 1) you should return a 400 status code and informative response if the id is not a positive integer and 2) this causes errors; for example, an id of 3.14 will be treated as 3 and so the wrong thing may be updated or deleted." | Added validation to check if `:id` is a positive integer before processing.                        | Made requests with invalid IDs (e.g., negative, non-numeric) to verify a 400 response.                   |
| "Validate Client Request Body for required fields was not implemented."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Implemented `validateApplication` middleware to check required fields in the request body.         | Sent POST and PUT requests with missing fields to ensure a 400 status code is returned.                  |
