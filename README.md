# Job Application Management API

## Author: Allahvel Salisbury

### Running the Server Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install dependencies using the command: <strong>npm install</strong>

4. Start the server using the command: <strong>npm start</strong>

5. The server should now be running locally on port 9000.

### API Methods and Routes
I suggest using Postman to send requests
(SERVER MUST BE RUNNING):

- `GET /applications`: Get all job applications.
- `GET /applications/:id`: Get a specific job application by ID.
- `POST /applications`: Create a new job application.
- `PUT /applications/:id`: Update an existing job application.
- `DELETE /applications/:id`: Delete a job application by ID.
